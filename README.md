# github-librejs

This project aims to make GitHub work without using their proprietary javascript, in a network-respecting way.


How to use:

0. Disable scripts on github, using [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), or librejs.
1. Install and enable [tampermonkey](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey), or another user script manager
2. Click on each script in this repository, then click "raw". Tampermonkey will ask you if you want to install the script.
3. Feel free to contribute back to this project through github, or using [git send-email](https://git-send-email.io/).
